# vyas-netlogo-model
An agent-based model in NetLogo simulating the dynamics of Transfer of Development Rights (TDR) for urban densification.

## Overview

This model explores how Transfer of Development Rights (TDR) policies can influence landowner behavior, development density, and spatial patterns in a simulated urban context. Agents interact based on zoning rules, incentive schemes, and the availability of sending and receiving zones.

It is developed independently using NetLogo and designed for use by researchers, urban planners, and policy analysts interested in compact growth, market-based instruments, and simulated urban governance.

## How to Run the Model

1. Open `tdr-simulation-ajithvyas.nlogo` in NetLogo (version 6.3 or later recommended).
2. Click **"Setup"** to initialize agents and zoning parameters.
3. Click **"Go"** to run the simulation.
4. Observe spatial and economic outcomes across sending and receiving zones.

## Model Parameters

- `incentive-rate`: Determines how attractive TDR transfers are.
- `landowner-threshold`: Willingness of agents to sell rights.
- `density-cap`: Maximum allowable FSI/FAR in receiving zones.
- `market-adjustment-rate`: Simulates how price responds to demand.

## Outputs

- Number of transfers completed
- Average price per TDR unit
- Density change in receiving zones
- Visual spatial footprint of densification
